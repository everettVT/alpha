### A simple agentic business automation tool. 
#!NOTE: I think we should structure the introduction of the project as a pitch, and then have explanations and usage patterns underneath.


#### Problem Statement
Humans are inherently limited in their capacity to communicate. 
  First, Communication between people is lossy. 
  We only have so much cognitive load to use, and when it’s gone, we have to wait until the next day. 

AI agents scale their communication with compute.

  
### So What problem are we actually solving? 
Current Enterprise AI tools lack the integrated context provisioning necessary to scale knowledge worker productivity. 
Every knowledge worker AND businesss has different processes, this means any solution built for one client won’t generalize to the next. 

Solution:
Alpha simplifies business process automation by empowering users to:
  1. Define their desired process with the assitance of an agent who then generates , review, and deploy 
so that swamped knowledge workers and business owners can delegate tedious tasks to a network of agents.

User

If we can figure out some sort of interactive interview process that the first agent will perform to gather data, then I think we have a really solid pitch.
